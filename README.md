# Project-SecureMeet
The COVID-19 pandemic has led to increased frustration among students, negatively impacting their mental health and leading to disruptive behaviour in online academic sessions. Some students share webinar links with miscreants, who then join meetings using fake identities to create disturbances. To address this, we created a prototype meeting platform - SecureMeet, a web application offering secure video conferencing, screen sharing, and chat functionalities. SecureMeet aims to enhance security by detecting foul language and malicious URLs in the chat and flagging the IPs of disruptive participants.

## Tech Stack:
- Node.js + Socket.io
- React JS
- MongoDB
- NLP
